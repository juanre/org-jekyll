;;; Extract subtrees from your org-publish project files that have
;;; a :blog: keyword and an :on: property with a timestamp, and
;;; export them to a subdirectory _posts of your project's publishing
;;; directory in the year-month-day-title.html format that Jekyll
;;; expects.  Properties are passed over as yaml front-matter in the
;;; exported files.  The title of the subtree is the title of the
;;; entry.  The title of the post is a link to the post's page.
;;;
;;; Look at http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.php for
;;; more info on how to integrate org-mode with Jekyll, and for the
;;; inspiration of the main function down there.
